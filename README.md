**Note App – Offline Notebook for Windows**

A simple offline notebook app for Windows to write notes, draw sketches, manage todos, and organize daily work in one place.
It is designed for students and office users who prefer a private, local-first productivity tool without relying on the internet or cloud services.

This project started as a personal tool to manage my own study notes and daily tasks. Later, I felt it could be useful for others too, so I decided to publish it.
